# Conglomerate

**This was a group project with Vanshika Agarwal, Razan Alkawai, Alice Gontijo, and Shree Kulkarni. They do not appear in the git history because this code was migrated from a private repository.**

## What Is Conglomerate? ##
Working in groups can be very problematic, especially when everyone has different schedules. These collaborations can require multiple platforms to communicate, and as students, this could reduce efficiency as shared information is distributed between the platforms.
The team ideated Conglomerate to create a space to unify common features required by groups/teams to effectively collaborate.

Conglomerate is a cross-platform mobile application that aims to optimise group-collaboration and make it more efficient.

## Conglomerate's Features ##
Students (target audience) can create profile using an email id and access profile related features such as choosing and setting a profile picture.
Upon becoming a user, one can create a new group or join an existing group using a group code or QR code, shared by the owner of the group. Upon becoming a member of a group, users can utilize the following features:
  1. Member's Features:

    e) Upload a document on any format
    f) Download a document onto their device's storage
    g) In-app messaging to all the members of the group which allows one to send and receive messages along with liking a message
    h) In-app notifications when a new message is received
    i) Leave a group
